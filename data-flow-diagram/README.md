## Data Flow Analysis

### Primary Data Flows

#### 1. **User Registration Flow**
```
Guest/Host → System → Users Database
          ↓
     Email Service (verification)
```

#### 2. **Property Search Flow**
```
Guest → System → Cache Store (check)
              ↓
         Properties Database (if cache miss)
              ↓
         Cache Store (update)
              ↓
         Guest (results)
```

#### 3. **Booking Flow**
```
Guest → System → Properties Database (availability)
              ↓
         Bookings Database (create)
              ↓
         Payment Gateway (process)
              ↓
         Users Database (update)
              ↓
         Email Service (notify)
```

#### 4. **File Upload Flow**
```
Host → System → Cloud Storage (upload)
             ↓
        Properties Database (store URL)
             ↓
        Cache Store (invalidate)
```

### Data Flow Characteristics

- **Bidirectional**: Most data flows are bidirectional, representing both requests and responses
- **Transactional**: Critical flows (booking, payment) maintain ACID properties
- **Asynchronous**: Notification and file processing flows can be handled asynchronously
- **Cached**: Frequently accessed data flows through cache layers for performance

## System Boundaries

The system boundary encompasses:

✅ **Inside the System**:
- RESTful API endpoints
- Business logic processing
- Data validation and transformation
- Internal databases and cache
