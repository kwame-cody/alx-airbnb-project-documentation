### **Airbnb Clone: User Stories**

This document outlines the user stories for the Airbnb Clone project, derived directly from the core use case diagram. Each story follows the standard format: **As a [user role], I want to [goal], so that [reason/benefit]**.

These user stories will serve as the foundation for our product backlog. They will guide the development team by defining the features from a user's perspective, helping us prioritize work and ensure we are building a product that delivers real value.

The stories are grouped by the core functionalities of the application.
