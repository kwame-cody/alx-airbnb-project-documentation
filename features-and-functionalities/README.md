# Airbnb Clone: Backend Project Requirement Document
---
## 1. Project Overview

This document outlines the core backend requirements for our **Airbnb Clone**, a platform designed to connect hosts and guests for short-term property rentals. The backend will serve as the central nervous system of the application, handling all data, business logic, and integrations. The primary goal is to build a **scalable, secure, and performant API** that supports a seamless and intuitive user experience.

## 2. Core Functionalities

The backend must support the following key features:

### 2.1. User Management
This module will handle all user-related operations, including registration, authentication, and profile management.
- **User Registration:**
  - Guests and hosts will be able to sign up via a simple form.
  - We'll use **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for stateless and secure authentication. 
- **User Login & Authentication:**
  - Users can log in with an email and password.
  - We will also support **OAuth** for social logins (e.g., Google, Facebook) to reduce friction.
- **Profile Management:**
  - Users can update their personal information, contact details, and preferences.
  - We'll enable users to upload and manage their profile photos.

### 2.2. Property Listings Management
This module empowers hosts to manage their properties.
- **Add Listings:**
  - Hosts can create new listings by providing essential details like title, description, location, price, amenities, and availability.
- **Edit/Delete Listings:**
  - Hosts will have full control to update or remove their listings as needed.

### 2.3. Search and Filtering
This functionality is crucial for guest discovery.
- **Search:**
  - Guests can search for properties based on location.
- **Filtering:**
  - Users can narrow their search results using filters for price range, number of guests, and available amenities (e.g., Wi-Fi, pool).
- **Pagination:**
  - We'll implement pagination to efficiently handle and display large result sets.

### 2.4. Booking Management
This is the core transaction module of the application.
- **Booking Creation:**
  - Guests can book a property for a specified date range.
  - The system must prevent double bookings through robust date validation logic.
- **Booking Cancellation:**
  - Guests and hosts can cancel bookings, adhering to predefined cancellation policies.
- **Booking Status:**
  - We'll maintain and track booking statuses (e.g., pending, confirmed, canceled, completed).

### 2.5. Payment Integration
This module will handle all financial transactions securely.
- **Secure Payment Gateway:**
  - We'll integrate with a reliable payment gateway like **Stripe** or **PayPal** to process payments. 
  - The system will handle upfront payments from guests.
  - The system will manage automated payouts to hosts after a booking is completed.
- **Multi-currency Support:**
  - The platform will support transactions in multiple currencies.

### 2.6. Reviews and Ratings
This module builds trust and provides social proof.
- **User Reviews:**
  - Guests can leave a review and rating for a property after their stay.
- **Host Responses:**
  - Hosts will be able to respond to reviews to provide context or address feedback.
- **Abuse Prevention:**
  - We'll link reviews directly to confirmed bookings to ensure authenticity and prevent abuse.

### 2.7. Notifications System
This module keeps users informed.
- We will implement an email and in-app notification system for critical events such as:
  - Booking confirmations and cancellations
  - Payment updates

### 2.8. Admin Dashboard
An internal tool to manage the platform.
- **Admin Interface:**
  - We will create an admin dashboard to monitor and manage users, listings, bookings, and payments.

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1. Database Management
- **Database:**
  - We will use a **relational database** like **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** due to its structured nature and support for complex relationships.
- **Tables:**
  - `Users` (Guests and Hosts)
  - `Properties`
  - `Bookings`
  - `Reviews`
  - `Payments`

### 3.2. API Development
- **Architecture:**
  - We will build a **RESTful API** to expose backend functionalities.
  - Each endpoint will adhere to standard HTTP methods (**GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE**) and status codes.
- **GraphQL:**
  - For complex data fetching, we may introduce a **GraphQL API** (optional but recommended) to allow front-end teams to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching.

### 3.3. Authentication and Authorization
- **Authentication:**
  - We'll use **JWT** for secure user sessions.
- **Authorization:**
  - We'll implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage permissions for Guests, Hosts, and Admins.

### 3.4. File Storage
- **Cloud Storage:**
  - We'll use a cloud-based storage service like **AWS S3** or **Cloudinary** to store user profile pictures and property images.

### 3.5. Third-Party Services
- **Email Service:**
  - We'll integrate with a service like **SendGrid** or **Mailgun** for reliable email notifications.

### 3.6. Error Handling and Logging
- We'll implement a **global error-handling mechanism** to provide consistent and informative error responses.
- Robust logging will be implemented for debugging and monitoring.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

### 4.1. Scalability
- **Architecture:**
  - The backend will be built with a **modular architecture** to support future growth.
- **Horizontal Scaling:**
  - We'll use **load balancers** to distribute traffic across multiple servers, ensuring the application can handle increased user load.

### 4.2. Security
- **Data Encryption:**
  - All sensitive data, including passwords and payment information, will be encrypted.
- **Threat Prevention:**
  - We'll implement **firewalls** and **rate limiting** to protect against malicious attacks.

### 4.3. Performance Optimization
- **Caching:**
  - We will use a caching layer, such as **Redis**, to improve the response time of frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
- **Database Optimization:**
  - We'll regularly optimize database queries to reduce server load and improve efficiency.

### 4.4. Testing
- **Automated Testing:**
  - We will implement comprehensive **unit and integration tests** using frameworks like `pytest` to ensure the reliability and stability of our API endpoints.
